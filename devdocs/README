Olli - Our Library's Life [Information | Investigation | Intelligence | ...]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Olli is (will be) a single-page web application for exploring as much data
as we can find regarding libraries in Manitoba.  It allows easy navigation
between data sets and across years, enables identification and comparisons
with peers selectable on various metrics, and generates reports suitable for
library strategic planning, board meetings, and sector planning and health
measurement.

Current data sets:
1. Library annual statistics (reported by libraries to Public Library Services)
2. Statistics Canada municipality-level census data

Possible future data sets:
1. Rural Development Institute's Self-Contained Labour Areas
2. Ecomonic Development Corporation data
3. ...?

Three components:
1. PostgreSQL database
   ./db
2. AngularJS Single Page Application client
   ./app
3. RESTful server modules using Perl Apache2::REST
   ./api

Development notes
=================
REST api
--------
Install libapreq (apache2 module) using muon or apt-get

Install Apache2::REST
$ sudo cpan -i Apache2::REST
Hmm... fails.

Try:
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-perl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libapache2-request-perl
Reboot, and retry installing Apache2::REST
Yep!

Access API root at: http://saiph.gotdns.org/api/
